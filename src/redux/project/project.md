Need two different actions that happen when a user clicks '+' next to an item.

1. When a user `isAnonymous` it should add to the favorites project.
1. When a user `isAuthenticated` it should display a popup asking what project to add the item to.

The icon needs three display modes.
1. (+) User has not added to the item to any projects.
1. (-) Anon user has item in favorites.
1. (...) Auth user has item in a project.
